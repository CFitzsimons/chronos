Contribution
============


Contribution should be pretty straight forward, follow these steps:

1. Create a folder inside modules for your code.
2. Create a function inside an index.js file that takes a discord message event as a parameter.
3. Have your module handle that event however you need it to.
4. Submit a pull request, once it's in the master branch of the project the server will automatically redeploy with your new module!
